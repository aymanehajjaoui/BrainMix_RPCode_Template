# BrainMix_RPCode_Template

This repository contains the C/C++ code template for the BrainMix project running on RedPitaya.  
It provides a modular and multithreaded base structure for real-time data acquisition, CNN-based signal processing, and DAC output.

## 🧠 Project Overview

BrainMix is designed to:
- Acquire interferometric signals in real-time from RedPitaya ADCs
- Process the signals using a CNN model (velocity prediction, etc.)
- Output results via DAC or CSV
- Use a modular, thread-based architecture per channel (CH1 & CH2)
